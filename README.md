A subset of the North Point web service library that includes our person matching algorithm. The algorithm accepts person data as function parameters with a Match Percent Minimum. A weight is calculated for each potentially matching person and those persons with a higher weight than the Match Percent Minimum are returned to from the function. The function also determines if each matching person is an exact match, so that an application using this function could automatically merge persons.
